# Learning Symmetries with Autoencoders
My final year project in theoretical physics is titled 'Learning Symmetries with Machine Learning', and in this repo I will be dealing with the (suprisingly difficult) problem of teaching the autoencoder to learn features of a triangular molecule in 3D space.

Neural networks in chemical physics struggle with the representation of coordinates in space [arXiv:2001.11696v2]. The reason for this stems from the NN not knowing that the physics of a molecule is invarient under rotation/translation of the positions of the coordinates, ie: the physics of a - <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?H_{2} />
